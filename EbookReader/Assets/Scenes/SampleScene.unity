    at his own neck until he drew blood. The feeling of slime and teeth lingered
    on his skin. </p><p>\u201CBoy! Stop your sniveling!\u201D </p><p>He remembered
    Jianzhu lighting the incense. He remembered the stickysweet smell and the deadness
    it created in his limbs. Stingjelly venom, his training told him. He\u2019d only
    just started his doses with Sifu Amak. </p><p>Yun blinked and tried to make sense
    of his surroundings. His hands clawed into wet, porous moss when it should have
    been the dust of the mining town under his fingernails. He was in a mangrove
    forest. The sky was the color of acid. </p><p>He crawled around, the juices of
    a swamp sucking at his knees. The trunks of the leafless trees twisted and gnarled
    as high as hills, barely lighter in color than silhouettes. Screened by the loose
    weave of branches, a great glowing eye stared at him. </p><p>It was the eye that
    had spoken. The eye that told him he wasn\u2019t the\u2014 </p><p>A pain, terrible
    and familiar, wracked his stomach and folded him in two. His forearms splashed
    into the swamp water. The landscape around him began to shake, not from earthbending
    but from something rawer and more uncontrollable. </p><p>He wasn\u2019t. End
    of sentence. He was nothing. </p><p>The shallow water danced, raindrops on a
    drum, spiking into geysers. The shoreline swayed, rattling the trees, bucking
    and clashing them together like the antlers of beasts locked in combat. Yun dashed
    his head against the ground in a frenzied corruption of a student bowing to their
    master. </p><p>Jianzhu.  His entire mind was a screamed name, a single screeching
    tone on a broken flute. His skull thudded against the brackish mud.  Jianzhu.
    </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">         <img src=\"images/img_0007.png\"

    epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"7\" id=\"7\"/><p>\u201CStop it, you miserable
    little brat!\u201D the eye roared. Despite its anger it shrank back from him,
    afraid of his throes of agony. The ground squeezed and fluttered, the heartbeat
    of a man falling to his death, pounding louder and louder before the final impact.
    </p><p>Yun  wanted  it to stop. He wanted the anguish to end. It hurt so much,
    to see everything he\u2019d worked for shredded to sparks and dust. It was destroying
    him from the inside. </p><p>So let it out. </p><p>The whisper came to him in
    his own voice. Not the eye\u2019s. Not Jianzhu\u2019s. </p><p>Put the pain outside.
    Put it somewhere else. </p><p>On someone else. </p><p>The rip started at his
    feet, a pinprick in overstretched silk. The tear birthed itself in the water
    and raced into the banks of the earth like lightning cracking the sky. The ground
    split apart, releasing all its quaking tension in one swift cataclysmic burst.
    </p><p>And then . . . stillness. </p><p>Yun could breathe again. He could see.
    The trembling had worn itself out, spent its energy in the creation of a long
    lesion in the ground, an unnatural wound upon the landscape. Swamp water poured
    into the injury, masking a depth he knew he shouldn\u2019t explore. </p><p>Things
    were so much clearer when there was relief. Yun used this moment of respite to
    look around. The musty grove resembled no forest he\u2019d ever seen. The dim
    light in the sky came from no discernible sun. This place was a hazy reflection
    of a real landscape, painted with ink that had been thinned too much. </p><p>I\u2019m
    in the Spirit World. </p><p>He backed away from the ravine that lay before him,
    not wanting to be dragged in by the force of the water\u2019s flow. Turning around,
    he pulled himself to drier footing using the exposed roots of a leathery tree.
    The air smelled like sulfur and rot. </p><p>Master Kelsang had told him about
    the Spirit World. It was supposed to be a beautiful, wild place, full of creatures
    beyond imagining. The realm of the spirits was a mirror held up to its visitors,
    a reflection of your emotions, a reality that shaped around your own spirit\u2019s
    intangible projection. </p><p>Yun flexed his fingers, finding them as solid as
    they could be. He wondered if the gentle monk had ever explored a nightmarish
    bog like this </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">        
    <img src=\"images/img_0008.png\" alt=\"Picture #8\"/>         </div>        
    <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"8\"
    id=\"8\"/><p>one. They\u2019d never talked about what happened if you entered
    the Spirit World while you were still in your body. </p><p>The rustle of branches
    gave him a start and reminded him he wasn\u2019t alone. The eye. It watched carefully
    from the darkness of the forest, circling him on translucent appendages studded
    with what he knew to be human teeth. He\u2019d felt its bite back in the mountains
    when it had sampled his blood. </p><p>A pulsing panic rushed through the chambers
    of his heart. Yun knew he was on borrowed time. He tried to remember what Jianzhu
    had called the spirit. \u201CFather . . . Glowworm?\u201D </p><p>The eye suddenly
    rushed closer, socketing itself in the gap between two nearby trees. Yun shrieked
    and fell backward on his elbows. He\u2019d made a mistake. A crucial, invisible
    barrier had been broken by saying the name aloud, and now he was more connected
    and vulnerable to it than ever. </p><p>\u201CI call myself that,\u201D the spirit
    said. Father Glowworm\u2019s pupil darted around unnervingly, the iris squeezing
    narrower. Its gaze had the heft of a probing tongue. \u201CNow, child, I believe
    you owe me your name.\u201D </p><p>Like a fool, Yun had fallen into the role

    poise was failing him. His slickness under pressure that had impressed the Fire
    Lord and the Earth King, the chieftains of the Water Tribes and Head Abbots of
    the Air Temples alike, was nowhere to be found. Maybe Avatar Yun had the confidence
    to talk his way out of this, but no such person existed anymore. </p><p>Father
    Glowworm shifted in the trees, and Yun knew he was going to die if he didn\u2019t

    the universal direction of amusement. \u201CBoy, do you think this is a game?\u201D
    </p><p>Everything is a game,  Yun thought, trying to still his shaking. /  will
    draw this one out as far as I can. I will survive a turn longer. </p><p>There
    was no more Avatar Yun. He would have to be Yun the swindler again. \u201CI can
    hardly be faulted for wanting to ask questions of a spirit wiser than the best
    of humanity.\u201D  When in doubt, flatter the mark.  \u201CThe Earth Kingdom\u2019s
    finest sages couldn\u2019t identify the Avatar for sixteen years. And yet you
    did it in a matter of seconds.\u201D </p><p>\u201CHmph. You don\u2019t fight
    the kind of battle Kuruk and I did and not be able to recognize your opponent\u2019s
    spirit. I could already feel Jianzhu bringing his reincarnation closer to one
    of my tunnels. It had to be one of you children.\u201D </p><p>Yun\u2019s ears
    perked at the word  tunnels.  \u201CYou have routes to the human world? More
    than one?\u201D </p><p>Father Glowworm laughed again. \u201CI know what you\u2019re
    doing,\u201D it sneered. \u201CAnd it doesn\u2019t impress me. Yes, I can create
    passages to the human realm. No, you will not trick or convince me into sending
    you back. You\u2019re not the bridge between spirits and humans, boy. You\u2019re
    the stone that needed to be pitched away by the sculptor. The impurity in the
    ore. I\u2019ve tasted your blood, and you\u2019re nothing. You\u2019re not even
    worth this conversation.\u201D </p><p>The eye crept closer. \u201CI can tell
    how upset you are by the truth,\u201D it said in a soothing sweet tone. \u201CDon\u2019t
    be. Who needs Avatarhood? You will find your own use, and your own immortality.
    Once I strengthen myself on your blood, part of your essence will exist within
    me, forever.\u201D </p><p>The problem with any game was that eventually, the
    opponent decided to stop playing. Father Glowworm suddenly rushed Yun, spiraling
    through the forest, tendrils of slime grasping and parting the trees like the
    beads of a curtain. </p><p>\u201CNow, be grateful!\u201D the spirit roared. \u201CFor

    id=\"10\"/><h4>UNFINISHED BUSINESS </h4><p>Brother Po once told Kuji the nickname
    for the  dao  sword was \u201Call men\u2019s courage.\u201D Hold the sturdy chopping
    blade that let you hack away at a foe with abandon, and you\u2019d feel braver
    immediately. </p><p>Kuji did not feel braver as he gripped the haft of his  dao 
    with clammy palms and watched the door. And his blade did not feel very sturdy.
    It was a rusted, chipped specimen that seemed like it would shatter if he waved
    it in the air too vigorously. As the most junior member of the Triad of the Golden
    Wing, he\u2019d had to wait at the back of the line as weapons were passed out
    in turn. This sword had come from the bottom of the crate. </p><p>\u201CNow you\u2019re
    a real soldier, eh?\u201D someone had joked at the time. \u201CNot like the rest
    of us hatchet men.\u201D </p><p>Brother Po stood by the doorway holding his small
    axe, the favored weapon of most of the Triad\u2019s seasoned fighters. He looked
    calm on the outside, but Kuji could see his throat bobbing up and down repeatedly
    as he swallowed, the same way it did when he was going for a big money play in
    Pai Sho. </p><p>If Kuji had confidence in anything for protection, it was in
    his gang\u2019s turf\u2014Loongkau City Block was practically a fortress. On
    the surface, Loongkau looked no different than its neighboring districts of Ba
    Sing Se\u2019s Lower Ring. The visible portion on the block rose a haphazard
    couple of stories into the air like a budding mushroom, in defiance of gravity
    and sound architecture. </p><p>But it was an open secret that the complex extended
    illegally into the ground layer by layer, far below the surface. Each level had
    been dug out below the previous one without a solid plan or understanding of
    safety, shored up by using only improvised supports of wood scrap, mud brick,
    bits of rusty scavenged metal. And yet Loongkau held solid without caving in,
    possibly with the aid of the spirits. </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">

    <span xmlns:epub=\"http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops\" epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"11\"
    id=\"11\"/><p>The inside of the block was a knot of twists and turns, staircases
    and empty shafts. Hives of squalid apartments squeezed the available pathways
    into narrow choke points. Loongkau was littered with natural traps like the room
    where Kuji and Po waited, which was one of the reasons why lawmen never went
    inside the City Block. </p><p>Until now. The boss had gotten a tip that the Golden
    Wing\u2019s stronghold was going to be hit this very day. Every brother was to
    take up positions until the threat was gone. Kuji didn\u2019t know what kind
    of enemy could get his elders so riled up. By his guess it would have taken more
    lawmen than the Lower Ring possessed in order to lay siege to Loongkau. </p><p>Regardless,
    the plan was sound. Anyone trying to make it to the lower floors would have to
    file through a narrow bottleneck that ran by this room. Kuji and Ning could get
    the drop on an intruder, two-on-one. </p><p>And it was unlikely they\u2019d see
    action, Kuji reminded himself. The level above was being prowled by Throatcutter
    Gong, the boss\u2019s best assassin. Gong could stalk and kill a mongoose lizard
    in its own jungle lair. The number of heads he\u2019d taken could have filled
    a haybarn\u2014 </p><p>A crash came from one floor up. There was no sound of
    a voice accompanying it. The little apartment began to feel less their turf to
    hold and more a box confining them like animals in a crate. </p><p>Po gestured
    with his hatchet. \u201CWe\u2019ll hear them coming down the stairs,\u201D he
    whispered. \u201CThat\u2019s when we strike.\u201D </p><p>Kuji tilted his ear
    in that direction. He was so desperate to hear any approaching signal that he
    lost his balance and stumbled. Po rolled his eyes. \u201CToo loud,\u201D he hissed.
    </p><p>As if to prove his point, someone flew through the doorway, snapping the
    hinges, and collided with Kuji. He shrieked and flailed with his  dao  but at
    best managed to smack the person in the head with his pommel. Po grabbed the
    attacker and raised his hatchet to strike, but checked his swing at the last
    second. </p><p>It was Throatcutter Gong, unconscious and bleeding. His wrists
    bent the wrong way and his ankles were bound with his own garrote wire. \u201CBrother
    Gong!\u201D Po shouted, forgetting his own lesson in stealth. \u201CWhat happened?\u201D
    </p><p>Prom the wall opposite the hallway they were supposed to be focusing on,
    a pair of gauntleted arms burst through the brick. They wrapped around Po\u2019s
    neck from behind in a chokehold, cutting off his words. Kuji saw his </p>

    epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"12\" id=\"12\"/><p>elder\u2019s eyes go white
    with terror before Po was pulled out of the room straight through the wall. </p><p>Kuji
    stared at the emptiness in stupefied disbelief Po was a big man, and in a blink,
    he\u2019d been taken like a raven eagle\u2019s prey. The hole he disappeared
    through revealed only darkness. </p><p>Outside, the floorboards creaked from
    the weight of a person walking, as if complete silence were a cloak the enemy
    could wear and discard at will. The treading of heavy boots came closer and closer.
    </p><p>The doorway filled, blacking out the faint light from the hall, and a
    tall, incredibly tall, figure stepped inside. A thin line of blood trickled from
    its throat, as if it had been beheaded and glued back together. A dress of green
    silk billowed underneath the wound. Its face was a white mask, and its eyes were
    monstrous streaks of red. </p><p>Trembling, Kuji raised his blade. He moved so
    slowly it felt like he was swimming through mud. The creature watched him swing
    his sword, its eyes on the metal, and somehow, he knew it was fully capable of
    putting a stop to the action. If it cared to. </p><p>The edge of the  dao  bit
    into his opponent\u2019s shoulder. There was a snapping noise, and a sudden pain
    lashed his cheek. The sword had broken, the top half bouncing back in Kuji\u2019s
    face. </p><p>It was a spirit. It had to be. It was a spirit that could pass through
    walls, a ghost that could float over floors, a beast impervious to blades. Kuji
    dropped the handle of the useless sword. His mother had told him once that invoking
    the Avatar could safeguard him from evil. He\u2019d known as a child she was
    making up stories. But that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t decide to believe
    them right now. Right now, he believed harder than he believed anything in his
    life. </p><p>\u201CThe Avatar protect me,\u201D he whispered while he could still
    speak. He fell on his behind and scrambled to the corner of the room, blanketed
    completely by the spirit\u2019s long shadow. \u201CYangchen protect me!\u201D
    </p><p>The spirit woman followed him and lowered her red-and-white face to his.
    A human would have passed some kind of judgment on Kuji as he cowered like this.
    The cold disregard in her eyes was worse than any pity or sadistic amusement.
    </p><p>\u201CYangchen isn\u2019t here right now,\u201D she said in a rich, commanding
    voice that would have been beautiful had she not held such clear indifference
    for </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">         <img src=\"images/img_0013.png\"

    </p><p>Kuji sobbed as a large, powerful hand gripped him by the chin with thumb
    and forefinger. It was gentle but gave the assurance that she could rip his jaw
    clean off his head if she so desired. The woman tilted his face upward. \u201CNow
    tell me where I can find your boss.\u201D </p><p>Kyoshi\u2019s neck itched terribly.
    The garrote had been coated in ground glass, and though she\u2019d managed to
    avoid getting cut too deeply, sharp little fragments still vexed her skin. It
    served her right for being so sloppy. The gang\u2019s wire man had been stealthy,
    but not at the level of the company she used to keep in her  daofei  days. </p><p>Speaking
    of which, she\u2019d taken a risk by not incapacitating the boy like she\u2019d
    done his elders. But he\u2019d reminded her of Lek. The way his stupid babyface
    tried to arrange itself in a mask of hardness, his obvious need for the approval
    of his sworn elder brothers. His sheer, idiotic bravery. He was too young to
    be running with a gang in the slums of Ba Sing Se. </p><p>No more exceptions
    for today,  she told herself as she stepped over rusting junk and debris. She
    was still in the habit of labeling anyone roughly her age as boys and girls,
    and the language made her inclined toward softness, which was dangerous. Certainly
    no one would show Kyoshi grace because she was only nearing eighteen. The Avatar
    did not have the luxury of being a child. </p><p>She pushed through a hallway
    barely wider than she was. Only the slightest cracks of illumination came through
    the walls. Glowing crystals were expensive, and candles were a fire risk, making
    light a premium in Loongkau. Networks of pipes dripped above her, pattering on
    the gilded headdress she wore despite the cramped environment. She\u2019d learned
    to account for the height it added, and having to stoop had been a fact of her
    life since childhood. </p><p>The smell of human density wafted through the corridors,
    a concoction of sweat and drying paint. She could only imagine what the lower
    levels offered the nose. The City Block packed more people into its limits than
    any other in the Lower Ring, and not all of its residents were criminals. </p>        
    <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">         <img src=\"images/img_0014.png\"

    epub:type=\"pagebreak\" title=\"14\" id=\"14\"/><p>Loongkau was a haven for the
    very poor. People with nowhere else to go squatted here and applied their industries,
    eking out livings as garbage piekers, \u201Cfell-off-the-wagon\u201D marketeers,
    unlieensed doetors, dodgy snaek vendors, and the like. They were ordinary Earth
    Kingdom eitizens trying to get by on the margins of the law. Her folk, essentially.
    </p><p>The shadowed eonflnes of the City Bloek were also home to a more violent
    sort, evolving gangs of the Lower Ring whose memberships were swelling from the
    influx of  daofei.  Bandits who eould no longer hold territory in the countryside
    were fleeing for the cover of Ba Sing Se and other large cities, blending in
    with the populace, hiding among the same refuge-seeking citizens they\u2019d
    brutalized in years past. </p><p>Those were not Kyoshi\u2019s folk. In fact,
    many of them were running from her.  But given it was just as likely for an apartment
    to be holding scared residents who had nothing to do with her quarry, Kyoshi
    was keeping her movements in check. Garden-variety earthbending that ripped up
    huge chunks of the surroundings would cause a dangerous collapse and harm innocents.
    </p><p>The interior opened into a small market area. She passed a room full of
    barrels leaking bright ink over the floor\u2014a home dying operation\u2014and
    an empty butcher stall clouded with buzzing ant flies. Jianzhu\u2019s study had
    contained his notes on the political and economic situation of Ba Sing Se, and
    the small reference to the City Block noted how enterprising its residents were.
    Curiously, it also mentioned that the land it was built on held some value due
    to its prominent location in the Lower Ring. Merchants in the Middle Ring had
    tried to purchase the block in the past and evict the residents, but the dangers
    of the gangs had always made such projects fail. </p><p>Kyoshi paused near a
    vat of spoiled mango pomace. This was her spot. She bent an assortment of rock
    debris into a small circle and stood on it. She crossed her arms over her chest
    to make the smallest cross section possible. </p><p>Before she went, though,
    she noticed a tiny object in the comer. It was a toy, a doll made of rags scavenged
    from a fine lady\u2019s dress. Someone in the block had gone through great effort
    to sew a doll made of fabric from the Upper Ring for their child. </p><p>Kyoshi
    stared at it until she blinked, remembering why she was here. She stamped down
    with her foot. </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">

    id=\"15\"/><p>Her little platform of earth, held together by her bending, turned
    as hard as the point of an auger. It burst through the clay tiles and rotting
    struts of wood, dropping her fast enough to make her guts lurch. She plunged
    through the floor and into the next level down, before doing it again, and again.
    </p><p>Jianzhu\u2019s tactical manuals noted that in enclosed fights most casualties
    happened at doorways and stairs. Kyoshi had decided to skip over those parts
    of the building and bore her own passage. She counted fourteen stories \u2014more
    than she\u2019d estimated\u2014until she came crashing through the ceiling of
    a room that was solid earth underneath. The bottom of Loongkau. </p><p>Kyoshi
    stepped off her platform, dust and crumbs of masonry cascading off her arms,
    and looked around. There were no walls in here, only supporting columns that
    propped up the great weight of the levels above.  So the City Block has a ballroom, 
    she thought wryly. The empty expanse was similar to the entertaining halls of
    wealthy nobles like Lu Beifong. There was a space like this in the Avatar\u2019s
    mansion in Yokoya. </p><p>She could see all the way to the far end since the
    walls held lumps of glowing crystal, as if the light for the entire building
    had been hoarded for this room. There was a desk, a wooden island in the emptiness.
    And behind the desk was a man who hadn\u2019t given up his pretensions since
    Kyoshi had last seen him. </p><p>\u201CHello, Uncle Mok,\u201D Kyoshi said. \u201CIt\u2019s
    been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201D </p><p>Mok, the former second-in-command
    of the Yellow Neck  daofei, goggled his eyes in surprise. Kyoshi was like a curse
    he couldn\u2019t shake. \u201CYou!\u201D he fumed, shrinking slightly behind
    the furniture as if it could protect him. \u201CWhat are you doing here!?\u201D
    </p><p>\u201CI heard rumors about a new boss settling into Loongkau and thought
    he sounded very familiar. So I came to investigate. I heard this group is calling
    itself a Triangle now? Do I have that right? Something with three sides.\u201D
    Kyoshi found it hard to keep track. The  daofei  who were funneling into the
    cities brought their grandiose customs of secrecy and tradition into the realm
    of urban petty crimes. </p><p>\u201CThe Triad of the Golden Wing!\u201D he yelled,
    infuriated by her disinterest in his rituals. But Kyoshi was long past caring
    about the feelings of men like Mok. He could throw whatever tantrum he desired.

    louder. The men Kyoshi had bypassed on the middle floors eame filing into the
    room, surrounding her. They brandished axes and eleavers and daggers. Mok\u2019s
    men had preferred outlandish weapons when they still roamed the countryside,
    but here in the city they\u2019d abandoned the nine-ring swords and meteor hammers
    for simpler arms that could be hidden in a crowd. </p><p>Bolstered by more than
    two dozen men, Mok turned calmer. \u201CWell, girl, what is it you want? Besides
    checking in on your elders?\u201D </p><p>\u201CI want you all to surrender your
    weapons, vacate the premises, and march yourselves to a magistrate\u2019s courthouse
    for judgment. The nearest one is seven blocks from here.\u201D </p><p>Several
    of the hatchet men burst out laughing. The corner of Mok\u2019s mouth turned
    upward. Kyoshi might be the Avatar, but she was vastly outnumbered and trapped
    in an enclosed space. \u201CWe refuse,\u201D he said with an exaggerated roll
    of his hand. </p><p>\u201CAll right then. In that case, I only have one question.\u201D
    Kyoshi cast her gaze around the room. \u201CAre you sure this is all of you?\u201D
    </p><p>The Triad members glanced at each other. Mok\u2019s face swelled with
    rage, reddening like a berry in the sun. </p><p>It wasn\u2019t insolence so much
    as pragmatism, her instinct for tidiness and efficiency rising to the surface.
    \u201CIf not, I can wait until everyone arrives,\u201D Kyoshi said. \u201CI don\u2019t
    want to have to go back and check each floor.\u201D </p><p>\u201CTear her apart!\u201D
    Mok screamed. </p><p>The hatchet men charged from all directions. Kyoshi drew
    one of her fans. Two would have been a bit much. </p><p>Kyoshi stepped over the
    groaning bodies. When one of the Triad members was too still, she nudged him
    with her boot until she saw signs of breathing. </p><p>Mok\u2019s robe had blown
    off in the scuffle. He managed to budge the chair he was sitting on a few inches
    in flight before Kyoshi put her hand on his shoulder, pressing him back into
    his seat. </p><p>\u201CNo need to get up yet. Uncle,\u201D she said. Past enmity
    or not, he was still older than her. </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">

    id=\"17\"/><p>Mok roiled with an anger and fear that Kyoshi could feel through
    her grip. \u201CSo, you\u2019re going to murder me in cold blood like you did
    Xu. May you be ripped apart by thunderbolts and many knives for slaying your
    sworn brothers.\u201D </p><p>Kyoshi found herself bothered, more than she should
    have been, by Mok calling her a murderer. She and Xu Ping An had agreed to a
    duel, and the man immediately tried to kill her. Once she\u2019d gained the upper
    hand, she\u2019d given him a chance to yield. The former leader of the Yellow
    Necks had amply demonstrated he was beyond saving. </p><p>And yet, during sleepless
    nights, she thought about Xu. The vile man infected her thoughts when she could
    have been dreaming of those she loved. She thought about Xu a great deal, his
    weight in her hands, and how, at the end of their fight, she\u2019d  decided.
    </p><p>Kyoshi cleared her head. \u201CAnything goes on the  lei tai,''  she said.
    Justifying the act out loud was bitter, ineffective medicine that she forced
    herself to swallow anyway. \u201CI\u2019m not going to kill you. You and your
    men got a foothold inside the walls rather quickly for a gang of countryside
    bandits who spent most of their history bullying farmers. You have a contact
    in Ba Sing Se helping you, and I want to know who it is.\u201D </p><p>Mok stiffened
    with purpose. True  daofei  never surrendered information to the authorities,
    even if it would benefit them. \u201CThe day I squeal to you, girl, is the day
    I\u2014 aieeeF\u2019\u2019 </p><p>Kyoshi reminded him that times had changed
    since they first met with a crushing squeeze of her fingers. She dented the nerves
    of his arm until the terms of their new relationship sunk in. </p><p>\u201CIt
    was someone from the Middle Ring!\u201D Mok said, once he stopped squealing in
    pain. \u201CWe used go-betweens; I don\u2019t know their name!\u201D </p><p>Kyoshi
    let go and took a step back. She\u2019d been expecting him to name a Lower Ring
    criminal, a local who\u2019d maybe sworn brotherhood to him in the past. The
    Middle Ring was the domain of merchants and academics. Something didn\u2019t
    add up here. </p><p>Mok clutched his shoulder and scrambled away from the desk.
    \u201CWai!\u201D he shouted at a door behind him. \u201CNow!\u201D </p><p>In
    her distraction, Kyoshi had forgotten the third leading brother of the former
    Yellow Necks. The door burst open in an ambush before Kyoshi could react. </p>

    raised, a snarl on his lips. He wasn\u2019t wearing the leather strap that covered
    his severed nose, and without it his gaunt face had a skull-like appearance.
    Wai had been a fast, vicious man back in his Yellow Neck days, and he still was.
    </p><p>But when he saw the intruder was Kyoshi, dressed in her full makeup and
    regalia, he gasped and nearly halted in midair. Wai was one of the few witnesses
    who\u2019d seen her in the Avatar State, and the experience had overawed the
    spiritual man. He stepped back to give her space, nearly knocking his brother
    over in his haste, and dropped to his knees. The knife that had been aimed at
    Kyoshi a second before, he placed at her feet like an offering. </p><p>\u201COh
    come on!\u201D Mok screamed as Wai bowed his head to the ground and prostrated 
    him self before the Avatar. </p><p>Kyoshi stepped out of the City Block into
    the street. The day had gotten brighter and hotter. A squad of peace officers,
    uniformed guardsmen of Ba Sing Se, waited for her, lining in wings to the left
    and right of the exit. The junior men who\u2019d never seen the Avatar before
    stared at Kyoshi as she emerged from the darkness. One of them dropped his truncheon
    and fumbled to pick it up. </p><p>Kyoshi walked past the rank-and-file guardsmen,
    ignoring the whispers and barely acknowledging the bows, until she reached Captain
    Li by the door. He was a sallow-faced man who\u2019d been on the job too long,
    his retirement delayed by gambling debts. \u201CThe cordon is set,\u201D he said
    to Kyoshi in a pipe-smoker\u2019s wheeze. \u201CNo trouble out here so far.\u201D
    </p><p>Most of the Lower Ring citizens went about their business, ignoring the
    presence of the law, but Kyoshi noticed a few people watching with fake disinterest,
    probably spotters for other unsavory organizations. Working with Captain Li meant
    flirting with a violation of Kyoshi\u2019s  daofei  oaths. She\u2019d sworn to
    her elder sister Kirima under a blade held by her elder brother Wong never to
    become a lackey of the law. </p><p>But Li had been her tool, her informant, not
    the other way around. He\u2019d provided her the intelligence she needed to close

    building safe?\u201D Li asked, tilting his cap to dab at his forehead with his
    cuff </p><p>\u201CThe Triad members are down and ready to be extricated,\u201D
    Kyoshi said. \u201CYou should summon a doctor.\u201D </p><p>\u201CITl get right
    on that,\u201D Li replied in a dull tone that let Kyoshi know how seriously he
    took the suggestion. He put his fingers to his lips and whistled. \u201CAll right,
    boys! Get the vermin out of there!\u201D </p><p>The guardsmen hustled into the
    City Block, free to move fast after Kyoshi had swept the twists and nooks of
    danger. She waited patiently to see the results of her work. The Triad of the
    Golden Wing needed to be counted and catalogued in the light of day. Being hauled
    away like dry goods would cause their mystique to blow away in the wind. Hopefully.
    </p><p>She heard loud voices and the sound of a struggle emerging from the darkness
    of Loongkau. Two officers dragged out a man who hadn\u2019t been among the Triads
    who\u2019d attacked her. He was dressed poorly, but a pair of glasses fell from
    his head. He had to have been a jeweler or a tailor to have invested in such
    an expensive device. </p><p>A boot crushed the glasses into the dust before she
    could say anything. With mounting horror, Kyoshi watched another set of officers
    come out, hustling a woman by the back of her neck. She held a wailing child
    in her arms. The man with bad vision heard the cries and began thrashing harder
    in the guards\u2019 grasp. </p><p>These weren\u2019t Triad members. They were
    one of the poor families who lived in the City Block. \u201CWhat are your men
    doing?\u201D Kyoshi shouted at Li. </p><p>He looked confused at her question.
    \u201CGetting rid of the bad element. Certain folks have been waiting to demolish
    this eyesore for a long time.\u201D He turned hesitant, a haggler afraid to part
    with too much of his money. \u201CDo . . . you want a cut? If you do, you have
    to talk to my man in the Middle Ring.\u201D </p><p>The Middle Ring.  In a flash,
    she understood. </p><p>Someone with big, lucrative plans for Loongkau wanted
    the residents scrubbed from the city block but needed an excuse to do it. They\u2019d
    let the Triads in first, to get the law and the Avatar involved, and then bribed
    Captain Li to clear out innocent and criminal folk alike. </p><p>\u201CStop this!\u201D

    without a speek of sineerity. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, Avatar, but I\u2019m aeting

    as necessary.\u201D </p><p>\u201CMama!\u201D  It was the little girl\u2019s sobbing
    that set Kyoshi over the edge. \u201CPapa!\u201D </p><p>Kyoshi drew her fans
    and snapped them open. She raised clumps of earth from below the dusty top layer,
    where the clay was still moist and malleable. Fist-sized clods shot forth, slamming
    over the mouths and noses of Li and his officers, clamping over their skin like
    muzzles. </p><p>The guards let go of the family and clawed at their faces, but
    Kyoshi\u2019s earthbending was too strong to be resisted. Li sank to his knees,
    his eyes goggling out. </p><p>They had time before they would suffocate to death.
    Kyoshi put back her fans and slowly went to each guard in turn, yanking off their
    headbands one by one, checking the square metal seals of the Earth King fastened
    to the cloth. </p><p>The badges of every official in Ba Sing Se had identification
    numbers engraved on them, a testament to the city\u2019s massive bureaucracy.
    These men, despite the shrinking supply of air to their brains, could understand
    the gesture of her taking their headbands and tucking them into her robes for
    safekeeping. One visit to an administration hall, and she could learn their identities.
    She could find them later. Most residents of Ba Sing Se had heard the rumors.
    They\u2019d heard stories of what Avatar Kyoshi was, and what she did to people.
    </p><p>Kyoshi saved Li for last. He\u2019d turned purple in the time she\u2019d
    taken to make the rounds. After snatching his headband from under his cap, she
    let the clay fall from his mouth, and the others\u2019 at the same time. Li\u2019s
    squad dropped to the ground, gasping for breath. The captain landed on his side
    and his inhalation rattled like dice in a cup. </p><p>She leaned over, but before
    she could say anything, Li threw a name at her, hoping to buy clemency. He really
    had no backbone. \u201CHis name is Wo! The man paying me is Minister Wo!\u201D
    </p><p>Kyoshi needed to shut her eyes so her frustration wouldn\u2019t leak out.
    There were probably a dozen Minister Wo\u2019s in Ba Sing Se. The name alone
    was meaningless to her. The city was too big. The Earth Kingdom was too big.
    She couldn\u2019t keep up with the corruption leaking from its holes. </p>

    is what\u2019s going to happen, Captain,\u201D she said as calmly as she could.
    \u201CYou are going to clear the block of the Triads and no one else. Then you
    are going to find paper and brush. You will write me a full confession, detailing
    this Wo person and every bribe you took from him. Every stroke of it the truth.
    Do you hear me. Captain Li? I will check. I want you to pour your very spirit
    into this confession.\u201D </p><p>He nodded. Kyoshi straightened up to see the
    woman and her daughter looking at her with wide, frightened eyes. She started
    to approach them, wanting to ask if they were hurt. </p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t touch
    them!\u201D The man who\u2019d lost his glasses threw  him self between Kyoshi
    and his family. With his near blindness, he wouldn\u2019t have seen her trying
    to help. Or maybe he had, and decided she was a danger to his wife and child
    anyway. </p><p>Farther away, around the edges of the cordon, more bystanders
    had gathered. They whispered to each other, the seeds of fresh rumors taking
    root in the soil. The Avatar had not only ripped apart the occupants of Loongkau,
    but she\u2019d turned her insatiable wrath upon the officers of the Earth King\u2019s
    justice as well. </p><p>The stares of the ordinary citizens and the terrified
    family made Kyoshi\u2019s skin prickle with a feeling that corrupt men like Li
    or Mok could never force on her. Shame. Shame for what she\u2019d done, shame
    for what she was. </p><p>Her makeup covered the flush in her cheeks and camouflaged
    the furrow in her brow. She gave Li one last meaningful tap and then walked away
    from Loongkau as slowly as she\u2019d arrived, an impassive statue heading back
    to the altar that gave it life. But really, underneath her paint, she was fleeing
    the scene of her crime, her heart threatening to pound her chest into dust. </p>

    who complained about how long it took to travel across Ba Sing Se were usually
    factoring in the congestion. That wasn\u2019t a problem for Kyoshi. Crowds tended
    to part out of her way like grass before the breeze. </p><p>She had another shortcut
    to exploit as well. It was possible to waterbend a makeshift raft upstream along
    the drainage canals running from the Upper Ring all the way out to the Agrarian
    Zone for irrigation. It was extremely fast, if you could stand the smell. </p><p>She
    reached the Middle Ring by the evening. Despite the orderly layout and numbered
    addresses, she struggled to find her direction in the uniformity of the white-painted
    houses and green-tiled roofs. She took paths leading her over peaceful bridges
    that spanned gently flowing canals, and along tea shops redolent with jasmine
    blossoms and trees shedding their pale pink petals over the sidewalks. As a child
    living in the gutters of Yokoya, Kyoshi used to imagine a paradise much like
    the Middle Ring. Clean, quiet, and food at hand anywhere you looked. </p><p>Store
    owners sweeping their floors would look up in surprise at her, but soon returned
    to their business. She passed a gaggle of dark-robed students that stared and
    elbowed each other to get a glimpse but didn\u2019t flee her gaze. People who
    were comfortable with their station in life tended to have less fear. They couldn\u2019t
    imagine danger in any form visiting their doorstep. </p><p>Kyoshi slipped out
    of sight into a darkened side street. She opened an unmarked door with a key
    she kept in her sash. The hallway she entered was as full of twists and stairs
    as Loongkau, but much cleaner. It ended with a passageway into a plain second-story
    apartment, furnished only with a bed and a desk. This room was one of several
    properties around the Four Nations that Jianzhu had bequeathed her, and it served
    as a safe room where she could sleep overnight when she didn\u2019t want to announce
    her official </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">

    id=\"23\"/><p>presence with the Earth King\u2019s staff. She unbuckled her bracers
    and peeled them off, tossing them on the bed as she crossed the floor. </p><p>She
    sank into the chair and dumped the pilfered headbands on the desk, the badges
    clattering over the surface like gambling winnings. She was more careful removing
    her headdress. A breeze rustled her freed hair, coming from the window that gave
    her an expansive sunset view of the Lower Ring in all its vastness and poverty,
    the brown shacks and shanties stretching over the land like leather drying in
    the sun. </p><p>It was an unusual layout for the apartment. Many Middle Ring
    houses did not have views that faced the Lower Ring. The merchants and financiers
    who lived in this district paid so they didn\u2019t have to look at unpleasantness.
    </p><p>Her fingers moved on their own, organizing the badges into neat stacks.
    A dull ache of exhaustion settled into her head. Today had added another complication
    to the pile. She would need to plan another visit to Loongkau to make sure the
    residents were safe within their homes. And she\u2019d have to follow up on Li\u2019s
    information, or else the captain and his backers would know they could simply
    wait until the Avatar had passed like a cloud overhead for them to resume their
    corrupt activities. </p><p>She knew it was a losing battle. In the grand scheme
    of things, singling out one dirty lawman in Ba Sing Se would have as much effect
    as pulling a raindrop out of the ocean. Unless ... </p><p>Unless she made an
    example of Li and whoever bribed him. She could hurt them so badly that word
    would spread about what happens when the Avatar catches you exploiting the defenseless
    for your own gain. </p><p>It would be quick. It would be efficient. It would
    be brutal. </p><p>Jianzhu would have approved. </p><p>Kyoshi slammed her hands
    against the desk, toppling the badges. She\u2019d slipped yet again into the
    mindset of her deceased \u201Cbenefactor.\u201D She\u2019d heard his words in
    her own voice, the two of them speaking with as much unity as the Avatars were
    supposed to be able to do with their past lives. </p><p>She opened a drawer and
    pulled out a hand towel that had been resting in a small bowl of special liniment.
    Kyoshi dragged the moistened cloth hard down the side of her face, trying to
    wipe away the deeper stains along with her makeup. </p><p>A shudder of revulsion
    ran up Kyoshi\u2019s back when she thought of how she\u2019d smothered Li with
    the exact same technique Jianzhu had once used on </p>         <div style=\"width:

    it, knowing exaetly what it felt like to die slowly as your lungs caved in on
    themselves. In dealing with Li, she\u2019d slipped as easily into Jianzhu\u2019s
    skin as she had her clothes. </p><p>The ones that had  also  been a gift from
    him. </p><p>She slammed her fist on the desk again and heard part of the joinery
    crack. It felt like every step she took as the Avatar was in the wrong direction.
    Kelsang would never have entertained violence as policy. He would have worked
    to improve the fortunes of the Loongkau and Lower Ring residents so they could
    push back against Triad domination and Middle Ring exploitation. He would have
    acted as their voice. </p><p>That was what Kyoshi had to do. In essence, it was
    what Kelsang had done for her, the abandoned child he found in Yokoya. It was
    the right course of action and would be the most effective in the long run. </p><p>It
    would just take time. A very . . . very long time. </p><p>A knock came from outside.
    \u201CCome in,\u201D she said. </p><p>A young man wearing the billowing orange
    and yellow robes of an Air Nomad opened the door. \u201CAre you all right. Avatar
    Kyoshi?\u201D Monk Jinpa said. \u201CI heard a loud noise and \u2014aaghT </p><p>The
    stack of letters he was holding went flying into the air. Kyoshi whipped her
    hand around and around in a circle of air-bending, corralling the papers with
    a miniature tornado. Jinpa recovered from his surprise and caught the pile of
    letters from the bottom of the vortex up, re-creating the stack, but with the
    corners sticking out at all angles. </p><p>\u201CApologies, Avatar,\u201D he
    said when he\u2019d secured her correspondence once more. \u201CI was surprised
    by your, uh . . .\u201D He gestured at his own face in lieu of pointing rudely
    at hers. </p><p>She hadn\u2019t finished wiping off the rest of her makeup. She
    probably looked like a doctor\u2019s illustration of a skull with the skin halfway
    stripped. Kyoshi grabbed the towel to finish the job. \u201CDon\u2019t worry
    about it,\u201D she said as she worked the cloth along the corner of her eye,
    taking care not to get the compound that would dissolve the paint into it. </p><p>In
    defiance of her order, Jinpa still looked worried. \u201CYou\u2019re also bleeding
    from your neck.\u201D </p><p>Yes. Right. With her free hand she opened a fan
    and aimed the leaf at the garrote wound around her throat. The shards of glass
    in her skin plucked themselves out under the force of her earthbending and balled
    into a </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">         <img src=\"images/img_0025.png\"

    to the floor when she switched her foeus to a nearby piteher. </p><p>A tiny wriggle
    of water snaked out of the vessel and wrapped itself around Kyoshi\u2019s neck.
    It was cool and soothing against the itch of the wound, and she could feel her
    skin knitting together. Jinpa watched her heal herself, both worried and horrified
    by the crudeness of her self-administered first aid. </p><p>\u201CIsn\u2019t
    healing water supposed to glow?\u201D he asked. </p><p>\u201CI\u2019ve never
    managed it.\u201D The mansion\u2019s libraries in Yokoya were full of extensive
    tomes about the medical uses of water-bending, but Kyoshi lacked time and a proper
    teacher. She\u2019d read through as many of the texts as she eould anyway, and
    the wounds she\u2019d been aecumulating as the Avatar gave her plenty of opportunities
    to praetice on herself. </p><p>She\u2019d made a vow. No matter how limited her
    knowledge was, or how flawed her teehnique, she would never again watch someone
    she eared about slip away in front of her while she did nothing. </p><p>She tossed
    the water baek in the pitcher and ran a finger over the marks left behind on
    her neck.  At this rate I\u2019m going to look like Auntie Mui\u2019s latest
    patchwork quilt.  She could hide the scar with more makeup or a higher collar.
    But the mottled, healed burns on her hands, courtesy of Xu Ping An, reminded
    her she was running out of body parts to injure and cover up. \u201CWhat are
    the updates?\u201D </p><p>Jinpa took a seat and pulled out one of the many letters
    addressed to the Avatar that he\u2019d already broken the seals on. He was allowed
    the privilege. During her first visit to the Southern Air Temple as the Avatar,
    he had helped her constantly with planning and communication, to the point where
    his elders shrugged and officially assigned him to Kyoshi as her secretary. Without
    his assistance, she would have been overwhelmed to the point of shutting down.

    its former peak population and ean now boast of a new school  and  herbal elinic,

    for more. </p><p>His lips pulled to the side. \u201CThe rest of the letters are

    </p><p>\u201CAll of them?\u201D She eyed the tall stack of papers and frowned.
    Jinpa shrugged. \u201CYou reject and ignore a lot of nobles. Earth Kingdom folk
    are nothing if not persistent.\u201D </p><p>Kyoshi fought the urge to set the
    whole pile of correspondence ablaze. She didn\u2019t have to read every message
    to know each one was a demand for the Avatar\u2019s favorable judgment on matters
    of business, politics, and money. </p><p>She\u2019d learned after the first few
    times. Kyoshi would accept an innocuous invitation to attend a banquet, preside
    over a spiritual ceremony, bless a new canal or a bridge. Inevitably, her host,
    the governor or the largest landowner\u2014oftentimes the same person\u2014^would
    corner her into a side conversation and beg for assistance in material affairs
    they would never have bothered Kuruk or Great Yangchen with. But Kyoshi was one
    of their own, wasn\u2019t she? She understood how business was done in the Earth
    Kingdom. </p><p>She did. It didn\u2019t mean she liked it. Sages who\u2019d vehemently
    denied her Avatarhood despite Jianzhu\u2019s last will and testament, nobles
    who claimed trickery after watching her twirl water and earth above her head
    with their own eyes, suddenly became true believers when they thought she could
    aid them in biting off greater mouthfuls of wealth and power in the endless hierarchies
    of the Earth Kingdom. The Avatar could settle where a provincial border lay,
    and which governor got to claim taxes from a rich cropland. The Avatar could
    speed a trade fleet along its route safely, protecting the lives of the sailors,
    but ultimately ensuring a massive profit for its merchant backers. Couldn\u2019t
    she? </p><p>Kyoshi soon learned to ignore such requests and focus on what she
    could wreak with her own hands. \u201CThose messages can wait,\u201D she said.
    She </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">         <img src=\"images/img_0027.png\"

    correspondence would blow away into dust if she sounded cold and authoritative
    enough. </p><p>Jinpa gave her a gentle but chiding look. \u201CAvatar ... if
    I may be permitted, you have to participate in high society to  some  extent.
    You can\u2019t keep putting off the leadership of the Earth Kingdom forever.\u201D
    </p><p>The Earth Kingdom doesn\u2019t have leadership,  Kyoshi thought. /  helped
    kill the closest thing to a leader it had. </p><p>\u201CThe duties of your role
    extend beyond being a powerful bender,\u201D he went on. \u201CYou\u2019ve scrubbed
    the countryside of the largest bandit groups, and it\u2019s impressive you were
    able to track down this Mok person and keep him from hurting more innocent people.
    But at this point you\u2019re running yourself ragged simply so you can beat
    up the same bad men you\u2019ve already beaten up in the past. Is scraping the
    bottom of the criminal barrel truly the most good you could do for the Four Nations?
    Not to mention the risks it poses to your personal safety.\u201D </p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s
    what I know.\u201D  And it\u2019s the only way I can be sure what I\u2019m doing
    is right. </p><p>They\u2019d had this conversation before, many times, but Jinpa
    never grew tired of reminding her. Unlike the other Air Nomads she\u2019d met,
    who prized detachment from the world, he was constantly pushing her to engage
    in a higher level of discourse with the very people who sought to exploit her.
    He wasn\u2019t much older than Kyoshi, slightly on the other side of twenty years,
    so it was strange when he spoke like a political tutor trying to guide a wayward
    pupil. </p><p>\u201CAt some point, you will have to stand upon a greater stage,\u201D
    Jinpa said. \u201CThe Avatar creates ripples in the world, whether they mean
    to or not.\u201D </p><p>\u201CIs that a saying among your mysterious friends
    whom you won\u2019t tell me about?\u201D she retorted. </p><p>He merely shrugged
    at her clumsy attempt to change the subject. That was the other frustrating thing
    about Jinpa. He wouldn\u2019t trade jabs with her like Kirima or Wong. He showed
    her too much respect, a problem her old companions never had, even after learning
    she was the Avatar. </p><p>She wondered what would happen if the monk ever met
    the remaining members of the Flying Opera Company. She could imagine Jinpa offering
    them assistance in escaping the  daofei  lifestyle. They probably would have
    tried to steal his bison. </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">

    id=\"28\"/><p>There was only one thing that could get her to talk to the sages.
    \u201CNone of the letters mentioned\u2014\u201D </p><p>\u201CMaster Yun? No,
    unfortunately. He has yet to turn up.\u201D </p><p>Kyoshi exhaled, a long hiss
    through her teeth. During the period where the world thought Yun was the Avatar,
    he had focused a great deal of effort on treating with the Earth Kingdom\u2019s
    elite. Which meant they were the only people who knew his face. Without a lead
    from someone who recognized him, finding one man in the entirety of the Earth
    Kingdom was like looking for a single pebble in a gravel pit. \u201CEet\u2019s
    try bumping up the reward again.\u201D </p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll
    help,\u201D Jinpa said. \u201CThe prominent figures of the Earth Kingdom lost
    a lot of face as a result of Master Yun\u2019s misidentiflcation. If I were them,
    I wouldn\u2019t want him to resurface. I would want to pretend the whole episode
    never happened. I hear Eu Beifong forbids anyone in his household, guests included,
    to speak of Jianzhu or his disciple.\u201D </p><p>Jinpa had a strange amount
    of access to political gossip for a simple Air Nomad, but his observations were
    usually correct.  That blastedpricklethorn Lu.  As Jianzhu\u2019s backer, the
    Beifong patriarch was just as guilty in Kyoshi\u2019s eyes for the mistake in
    identifying the Avatar, and he continued to cast off any further responsibility
    in the matter. </p><p>She\u2019d begged Eu Beifong in person to help her find
    Yun, expecting the old man to have some semblance of grandfatherly attachment
    to him. Instead Eu coldly revealed that the letter Jianzhu had sent to sages
    across the Earth Kingdom proclaiming Kyoshi to be the Avatar also said Yun was
    dead. Between Jianzhu\u2019s final words and Kyoshi\u2019s confused testimony
    of the incident in Qinchao, Eu chose to believe what was most convenient for
    him. As far as he was concerned, the scandal had resolved itself A victory for
    neutral  jing. </p><p>Jinpa gave her a smile out of sympathy. \u201CNo one\u2019s
    asking you to give up your search for the false Avatar, but maybe\u2014\u201D
    </p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t call him that! \u201D </p><p>Her rebuke echoed through
    the room. Thinking about how easily Yun had been abandoned, first by Jianzhu,
    then by Eu and the rest of the Earth Kingdom, had set her back on edge. Jinpa
    avoided her gaze, lowering his head. In the awkward silence he wiggled his foot
    nervously. She didn\u2019t need bending to feel the tremors through the floor.

    and appearances. They\u2019ll be paying closer attention than your average bystander.\u201D
    </p><p>It was a good idea. Better than any she\u2019d had so far. She felt doubly
    bad for losing her temper. She needed to apologize for her outburst, needed to
    stop having such outbursts if she and Jinpa were to ever shorten the distance
    between them. </p><p>But she was fearful of what lay at the end of friendships.
    She had been a danger to every companion she ever had. And she still couldn\u2019t
    shake the memories of an Air Nomad who gave her jokes and warmth and easy smiles.
    </p><p>\u201CMake it happen,\u201D Kyoshi said curtly. </p><p>Jinpa nodded. Then
    he paused, as if wondering how to frame his next statement. \u201CI didn\u2019t
    open all of today\u2019s letters. One of them came by special courier.\u201D
    </p><p>\u201CHalf the letters we get are by \u2018special courier,\u201D\u2019
    Kyoshi scoffed. Grandiose deliveries with envelopes stamped with  Urgent  and 
    For the Avatar s Eyes Only  in loud green ink were common tricks the Earth Sages
    tried, in order to grab her attention. </p><p>\u201CThis one is genuinely special.\u201D
    Jinpa reached into his robe and pulled out a message tube he\u2019d been safekeeping.
    </p><p>It was red. </p><p>The sturdy metal tube was end-capped with gilded flames.
    In the surroundings of the staid but clearly Earth Kingdom furnishings of the
    apartment, the scroll case looked like an ember in a forest, threatening to catch.
    An army of wax seals guarded the seams. </p><p>Jinpa passed it to her with both
    hands like an object of reverence. \u201CI believe this is from Fire Ford Zoryu
    himself.\u201D </p><p>Her first direct correspondence from a head of state. Kyoshi
    had never met the Fire Ford, nor had he ever written her before. The only contact
    she\u2019d had with the Fire Nation government was the envoy who\u2019d visited
    her in Yokoya soon after the news broke of her Avatarhood. The sharply dressed
    minister had watched her raise a modicum of all four elements, nodding to himself
    as each one was checked off in turn. He\u2019d saluted Kyoshi, politely stayed
    for dinner, and then left for his homeland the next </p>         <div style=\"width:

    state of affairs. She remembered appreeiating the lack of grief the foreign delegate
    gave her in comparison to her own countrymen. </p><p>Breaking the seals and opening
    the case felt like damaging a historical artifact. Kyoshi kept as much of the
    wax\u2019s original shape as she could and unfurled the scroll inside. </p><p>The
    writing was direct and to the point, devoid of the flourishes Earth Kingdom officials
    thought were necessary to curry favor with her. Lord Zoryu needed the Avatar\u2019s
    assistance on a matter of national importance. If she would come visit the royal
    palace as his honored guest to celebrate the upcoming Festival of Szeto, a significant
    holiday in the Fire Islands, he could explain further in person. </p><p>\u201CWhat
    does it say?\u201D Jinpa asked. </p><p>\u201CIt\u2019s an invitation to visit
    the Fire Nation.\u201D A debut on the world stage. She swallowed the nervousness
    that had suddenly clumped in her throat. </p><p>Jinpa saw her hesitation and
    clasped his hands together, beseeching. \u201CThis is exactly what I\u2019m talking
    about. Avatar. The Four Nations aren\u2019t going to let you remain out of the
    public eye forever. Please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019d snub the Fire Lord,
    of all people.\u201D </p><p>Kyoshi mulled it over. She doubted the ruler of the
    Fire Nation would waste her time with a frivolous request for help. And her frustrations
    with her own country were threatening to push her past her breaking point. A
    change of scenery might be called for. </p><p>\u201CAnd it\u2019s a holiday festival,\u201D
    Jinpa added. \u201CYou might even have fun. You  are  allowed to enjoy yourself
    from time to time, you know.\u201D </p><p>Leave it to an Air Nomad to fall back
    on fun as the last argument. \u201CYou can write back and tell the Fire Lord
    I am honored to accept his invitation,\u201D she said. \u201CWe\u2019ll start
    planning the trip tomorrow. I don\u2019t think I can handle any more business
    for today.\u201D </p><p>Jinpa bowed solemnly, hiding his satisfaction that finally
    the Avatar was stepping up to her responsibilities. \u201CNo one needs their
    rest more than the Avatar.\u201D He left the room for the office they\u2019d
    set up down the hall. </p><p>Alone, Kyoshi stared at the cream-colored paper
    in silence. She hadn\u2019t mentioned to Jinpa the portion of the letter that
    tipped the scales in favor of the visit. </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">

    id=\"31\"/><p>It was a very specific piece of news at the end of the Fire Lord\u2019s
    message. The former Headmistress of the Royal Academy had returned home after
    a long convalescence in Agna Qel\u2019a, the capital of the Northern Water Tribe.
    So had her daughter. Perhaps the Avatar would like to see them, given the three
    had been acquaintances in Yokoya? They certainly wished to see her. </p><p>Acquaintances. 
    Kyoshi didn\u2019t know it was possible to feel such relief and distress at once.
    She wasn\u2019t in the Fire Nation yet and already she could picture who was
    waiting for her, the walking blaze of pure heat and confrontation. In the darkness
    of her exhaustion, a point of shining light beckoned. </p><p>Rangi. </p><p>Kyoshi
    carefully folded the paper and tucked it into her robes, close to her thumping
    heart. Despite her secretary\u2019s wishes, she was not going to be getting much
    sleep tonight. </p>         <div style=\"width: 99.68627450980392%;\">
